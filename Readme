Overview

This project was deployed using Terraform to provision infrastructure on GCP. The Docker image was built locally, pushed to Google Artifact Registry, and then used by Cloud Run to run the application.

Prerequisites

Google Cloud SDK installed and configured with appropriate permissions.
Terraform installed and configured.
Access to Google Artifact Registry.
Docker installed locally for image building.

Infrastructure Setup

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply


Terraform provisions:

Google Artifact Registry for storing container images

Cloud Run service to run the containerized application

Supporting IAM roles, permissions, and network configuration

Build and Push Docker Image

After Terraform created the infrastructure, the Docker image was built locally and pushed to the Artifact Registry:

# Authenticate Docker with Artifact Registry
gcloud auth configure-docker REGION-docker.pkg.dev

# Build Docker image
docker build -t REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/REPO_NAME/IMAGE_NAME:TAG .

# Push Docker image
docker push REGION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/REPO_NAME/IMAGE_NAME:TAG
